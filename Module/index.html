						<h1>France</h1>
					</div>
					<p>From the boulevards of Paris to the fashionable seaside resorts of the Cote d'Azur,
					France offers some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. France delights romantics with
					fairy-tale castles, soaring cathedrals, and picture-perfect villages, yet still impresses 
					realists with its progressive, contemporary style. Begin with the Eiffel Tower, the modern emblem of France.
					Then discover famous masterpieces of art at the Louvre Museum. Spend a day pretending to be royalty at 
					the elegant Palace of Versailles. Save time for leisurely gourmet meals; traditional French gastronomy 
					has been inscribed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Each region has its own distinctive cuisine and culture. 
					Quaint fishing villages of Brittany specialize in crepes and seafood, while cozy chalets in the French Alps serve hearty cheese
					fondue with charcuterie. Indulge in it all and savor the irresistible charm of France.Praesent condimentum non leo ac dictum. Nulla rhoncus non tellus ac auctor. Cras malesuada, lectus id tincidunt finibus, nisi est.</p>

						<h1>Japan</h1>
					</div>
					<p>Many first-time visitors to Japan are often surprised to learn that as one of the world's most advanced 
					industrialized nations, this relatively small Asian country also boasts a rich and fascinating history 
					that dates back thousands of years. Indeed, long before many of Europe's most spectacular cathedrals were built, 
					Japan's Shinto and Buddhist temples were already well-established and drawing pilgrims and patrons for their 
					often elaborate designs and decor. At the same time, the country was already perfecting the skills and trades 
					that would set it on the path to riches, from fine porcelains and ceramics to textiles such as silk. Much of this rich tradition has, despite wars and natural devastation, been preserved (or rebuilt), and these days, a visit to Japan is a memorable adventure. Praesent condimentum non leo ac dictum.
